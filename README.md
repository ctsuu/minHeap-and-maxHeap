# minHeap-and-maxHeap
minHeap and maxHeap in python notebook
Refer to https://github.com/joeyajames/Python

Locate parent and child
for example
```
i=4
parent[i] = i/2 = 2
left[i] = i*2 = 8
right[i] = i*2 + 1 = 9
```
```
Heap operations:
*Push (insert)
*Peek (get max or min)
*Pop (remove max or min)
```
```
Push:
-Add value to end of array
-Float it up to its proper position
```
```
Pop:
-Move max or min to end of array
-Delete it
-Bobble down the item at index to it's proper position
-return max or min
```
